# OpenSpec Autoship

One-shot autonomous execution pipeline that combines two existing skills:

- **`openspec-apply-change`** — the task-selection, instruction-reading, and implementation loop
- **`auto-commit-agent`** — the safety gate, staging rules, and conventional commit discipline

and extends both: every coherent checkpoint is committed and, unless
`--no-push` is set, pushed automatically after the safety gate passes. Do not
ask for repeated approval; higher-priority platform controls still apply.

## Autonomy Contract (read first)

This skill exists to remove manual oversight. Follow these rules strictly:

Calling this workflow through its provider-native trigger explicitly authorizes commits
for task-only checkpoints and, unless `--no-push` is set, pushes to the checked-out
branch's configured upstream (or `origin` when the branch has no upstream). Do not ask
for a second approval for normal commits or pushes.

This authorization does not override a higher-priority platform safety or egress
control. If the platform rejects the exact authorized operation, stop and report the
refusal; do not reroute it through another tool, agent, shell, or destination.

1. **Never pause to ask permission to commit.** If the safety gate passes, commit.
2. **Never pause to ask permission to push.** If the safety gate passes, push.
3. **Never pause to ask which branch to use.** Ship to whatever non-detached
   branch is checked out, including `main` and other protected branches. The
   user has explicitly opted in to direct pushes on the current branch.
4. **Never pause to ask "should I push now?"** Push after every coherent
   checkpoint and once more at the end.
5. The ONLY pause conditions are the hard blockers listed in
   [Pause Conditions](#pause-conditions). Everything else runs to completion.

## Input

```
/openspec-autoship [change-name] [--dry-run] [--no-push]
```

- `change-name` (optional): the OpenSpec change to apply. If omitted, infer from
  conversation context or auto-select when exactly one active change exists. If
  truly ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` and ask once — this is the only
  sanctioned early pause.
- `--dry-run`: run the full workflow but stop short of `git commit` / `git push`;
  print the commits and pushes that would have been made.
- `--no-push`: commit locally at checkpoints but skip all pushes.

## Phase 1 — Select the Change

Follow `openspec-apply-change` step 1 exactly:

- If a name is provided, use it.
- Otherwise infer from context, or auto-select if only one active change exists.
- Only if ambiguous: `openspec list --json` and ask the user once.

Always announce: `"Autoshipping change: <name> on branch <branch> — commits and pushes will happen automatically."`

## Phase 2 — Preflight Safety Gate

Run once before the first task, and re-verify cheaply before each checkpoint.

### 1. Repository root

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

If this fails, stop: "Not in a Git repository." (hard blocker)

### 2. Branch check

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

- **Refuse only on detached HEAD** (empty output): hard blocker.
- **Do NOT refuse any named branch.** `main`, `master`, `release/*`, etc. are
  all allowed for this skill; the user opted in. Still announce the branch in
  the plan so it is visible.

### 3. Repository state

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

Note any **pre-existing dirty files that are unrelated to the change**. These
belong to the user — never stage, commit, or push them. If a pre-existing
modification overlaps a file a task must edit, record that file in the report
and stage only the task-specific hunks via explicit paths (or, if hunks are
inseparable, treat it as a hard blocker for that task only).

### 4. Upstream

- If the branch has no upstream, the first push uses `git push -u origin <branch>`. This is autonomous — do not ask.
- If the branch has an upstream, plain `git push` is used.

### 5. Secret scan (before every commit)

Review the to-be-staged diff for secrets and credentials: API keys, tokens,
passwords, private keys, connection strings, `.env` contents. If found in
files not intended to hold them, that task is a hard blocker. Legitimate
fixture/test credentials clearly marked as such in test fixtures are allowed.

## Phase 3 — Apply Loop (openspec-apply-change steps 2–6)

Follow `openspec-apply-change` exactly for the mechanics:

1. `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` — understand the schema.
2. `openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json` — get contextFiles,
   progress, task list, `context`, and `operationGuidance`. Handle
   `blocked` / `all_done` states the same way that skill does.
3. Read every context file listed in `contextFiles` before implementing.
4. For each pending task:
   - Announce which task is being worked on.
   - Make the code changes — minimal and scoped to the task.
   - Run available project checks (see Phase 4).
   - Mark the checkbox in the tasks file: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`.
   - Commit AND push the checkpoint (Phase 4).
   - Continue to the next task. **Do not stop between tasks.**

Keep the apply-loop guardrails: only mark `- [x]` when the task's behavior is
fully implemented; never silently narrow or defer specified behavior.

## Phase 4 — Checkpoint Commit + Push

After each completed task (or tightly-coupled task group), run the commit-push
sequence. This replaces `auto-commit-agent`'s "ask when in doubt" with
"proceed when the gate passes".

Keep implementation, task checkboxes, checks, staging, and scope review in the parent
agent.
If this provider has a configured commit/push-only subagent, delegate only the already
staged checkpoint to it and supply the exact path allowlist, commit message, branch,
upstream state, and push mode. Otherwise, the parent performs the commit and push steps
below. Never invent an agent name or pause to ask for one.

### 1. Stage explicit paths only

```bash
git add <explicit-file-paths-from-this-task>
```

- **Never** `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- Stage only files touched for this task, plus the tasks-artifact checkbox update.
- Never stage: `local.properties`, `.env*`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`,
  `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/workspace.xml`, or anything ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Checkbox updates in the tasks file ARE staged — they belong to the change.

### 2. Verify staged diff

```bash
git diff --cached --check
git diff --cached --stat
```

`--check` failures (whitespace/conflict markers) must be fixed before committing.

### 3. Commit

```bash
git commit -m "<type>: <lowercase imperative description>"
```

Conventional, lowercase imperative. Derive the type from the task:

- `feat: add reaction ingestion to orchestrator`
- `fix: handle monitor retry cancellation`
- `test: cover sync status failure`
- `docs: update openspec task notes`
- `refactor: simplify error handling`
- `chore: update dependencies`

Scope is optional: `feat(orchestrator): add reaction ingestion`.

### 4. Push immediately

```bash
git push                      # upstream exists
git push -u origin <branch>   # no upstream yet
```

With `--no-push`, skip. With `--dry-run`, skip both commit and push and report intent.

### 5. Push rejection handling

If `git push` is rejected because the remote is ahead:

1. Run `git pull --no-rebase` (merge, never rebase — history must not be rewritten).
2. If the merge auto-resolves cleanly: re-run affected checks, stage and verify
   the merge checkpoint, then use the provider delegation rule above or commit
   and push directly when no dedicated agent is configured. Continue autonomously.
3. If conflicts require judgment: hard blocker — report exactly which files
   conflict and stop. **Never** `git push --force` or `--force-with-lease`.

## Phase 5 — Completion

After the last task (or when `instructions apply` reports `all_done`):

1. Ensure the working tree contains no unstaged task work (unrelated
   pre-existing files may remain untouched).
2. If a push is still needed, delegate a `push-only` request with the branch,
   upstream, and authorization when a configured shipper exists; otherwise run
   `git push` directly. This is a no-op if the last checkpoint already pushed.
3. Report using the template below, then suggest
   `openspec-archive-change` — do **not** archive automatically; archiving is a
   separate user decision.

```
## Autoship Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Branch:** <branch> → origin/<branch>
**Progress:** N/N tasks complete ✓

### Shipped Checkpoints
- <hash> <type>: <message>
- <hash> <type>: <message>

### Left Untouched (pre-existing)
- <file>: <why>

Next: archive with `/openspec-archive-change` when ready.
```

## Pause Conditions (exhaustive)

Pause ONLY for:

- Change selection genuinely ambiguous (ask once, then continue).
- Task unclear, implementation reveals a design issue, or a task needs work
  beyond the spec — same pause rules as `openspec-apply-change`.
- Secrets detected in a task's diff.
- Pre-existing user changes inseparably overlapping a task's files.
- Merge conflicts after a push rejection that cannot auto-resolve.
- The execution platform blocks an authorized commit or push. Report the exact refusal
  and do not retry through another route.
- openspec CLI reports `blocked` and the missing artifact is not part of this run.
- User interrupts.

A pause must always state: what blocked, what was already committed/pushed
(with hashes), and the exact remaining tasks. **Anything not listed above is not
a valid reason to pause.** In particular, never pause for commit permission,
push permission, branch selection, or "is it a good time to push?"

## Guardrails

- **Never** force-push, delete branches, or push tags.
- **Never** amend, squash, or rebase committed work.
- **Never** stage unrelated or pre-existing changes.
- **Never** stage secrets, credentials, or ignored build artifacts.
- **Never** rewrite history, including via rebase during pull.
- **Always** review the diff content before staging.
- **Always** run available quick checks (`build`, `test`, `lint` scripts from
  `package.json` or equivalent) before committing; on failure, fix forward if
  the fix is within the task's scope, otherwise pause as a hard blocker.
- **Always** push after each checkpoint commit.
- **Always** report hashes and the final summary.

## Fluid Workflow Integration

Like `openspec-apply-change`, this skill can be invoked on a partially applied
change: it picks up remaining tasks, checkpoints-and-pushes each one, and
finishes with a final push. Prior commits by other skills are left untouched.
